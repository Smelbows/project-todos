# Project Todos

Project todos uses React and Redux to create a simple to-do app where it's possible to add, delete and mark tasks as complete.

## The problem

This week I was sick so I made the decision to focus on functionality and leave styling alone. I started with the reducer and built the functionality of the React components around how I wanted redux to controll the state.
